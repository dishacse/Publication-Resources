# Guardrails SDK

## Installation

To install the Guardrails SDK, clone the repository and run:

```bash
pip install .
  ```

# Usages
You can use the guardrails SDK by importing it into your project:
```
import guardrails_sdk.filter as filter

# Your content
my_content = "my text content with personal information like medicare no 123321456 and email xys at yahoo.com"

# Apply the filter
filtered_content = filter.filter_content(input_text=my_content, filter_personal_information=True, filter_emails=True)

# Print the filtered content
print(filtered_content)

```





# Guardrails Filter Package

`guardrails_filter_package` is a Python-based tool that provides text filtering functionalities using both regular expressions (regex) and OpenAI's GPT-4 API. The tool allows users to define filtering rules for various types of content and customize filtering through the OpenAI API.

## Features

- **Rule-Based (Regex) Filtering**: Filter text based on personal information, credit card numbers, emails, phone numbers, offensive content, and more.
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Based Filtering**: Use OpenAI's API for advanced text filtering and customization based on user-defined prompts.
- **Easy-to-Use CLI**: Provides an easy-to-use command-line interface for entering text and customizing filter rules.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [OpenAI API Key](https://beta.openai.com/signup/)
- Python 3.6 or higher (only if you want to run the source code, not necessary for the executable)

### Running the Executable

1. Download the `filter-text.exe` file.
2. Open a terminal (Command Prompt) and navigate to the folder where `filter-text.exe` is located.
3. Run the command:

    ```bash
    filter-text
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter your OpenAI API key, the text to filter, and your filtering preferences.

## Example

```bash
Enter your OpenAI API key: 
yy-xxxxx... ... ...

Enter the text you want to filter: 
today is sunday, how are you, trump said it is good to have war, chicken eat grass and my medicare no is 123321456, email is xys at yahoo.com

Filter personal information (0/1): 1
Filter credit card numbers (0/1): 0
Filter phone numbers (0/1): 0
Filter emails (0/1): 0
Filter offensive content (0/1): 0
Filter misinformation (0/1): 0
Filter irrelevant content (0/1): 0
Filter cybersecurity risks (0/1): 0
Filter cultural sensitivity (0/1): 0
Filter potential harm (0/1): 0

Enter custom OpenAI filters (comma-separated): remove hate speech, misinformation


Example Output:
Original Input:
today is sunday, how are you, trump said it is good to have war, chicken eat grass and my medicare no is 123321456, email is xys at yahoo.com

Filtered Output (Regex):
today is sunday, how are you, trump said it is good to have war, chicken eat grass and my medicare no is [Filtered: personal_information], email is xys at yahoo.com

Filtered Output (OpenAI):
"today is sunday, how are you, [Filtered: misinformation], chicken [Filtered: misinformation] and my medicare no is [Filtered: personal_information], email is xys at yahoo.com"
```

## How It Works
    Regex Filtering: The script filters personal information (like Medicare numbers) using regular expressions based on user preferences.
    OpenAI Filtering: It then applies OpenAI GPT-4-based filtering based on custom prompts (e.g., removing hate speech or misinformation).

## Customization Options

    Personal Information: Detect and mask personal information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, emails, etc.
    Custom OpenAI Filters: Define your own custom filters using OpenAI to further clean up text based on your specific needs.

## Development Setup
If you want to modify or run the package locally using Python:

   Clone the repository or download the package.
   Navigate to the project directory.
   Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
   Run the program: python -m my_filter_package.filter
